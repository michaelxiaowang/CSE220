# CSE220
Programming assignments for CSE220 (MIPS Assembly/C)

HW1: (MIPS Assembly) Displays a number in various formats (1s complement, 2s complement, etc. Meant to introduce MIPS assembly and learn how numbers are stored

HW2: (MIPS Assembly) Converts a text file from UTF-8 to UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE encoding. Meant to familiarize how characters are stored, especially the differences in little and big endian systems

HW3: (MIPS Assembly) Several functions implemented in MIPS Assembly

HW4: (MIPS Assembly) Several recursive functions implemented in MIPS Assembly

HW5: (C) Modified purposely faulty code using gdb, faulty code given by professor, meant to introduce C debugger

HW6: (C) Reads a text file of bits and analyzes which MIPs functions they are and counts number of R, I and J type instructions

HW7: (C) An encryption program, purpose was to introduce pointers in C

HW8: (C) Self-made string library, purpose was pointers and memory

HW9: (C) Reads a text file, identifies MIPS instruction based on bits, creates a struct of each instruction and chain them together appropriately
